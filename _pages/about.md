Hello! I’m Yixiang Jin, a passionate researcher and engineer in the field of robotics. I hold a Ph.D. in Robotics from the [University of Sheffield](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/), where I was awarded the [RAIN](https://uomrobotics.com/collaborations/rain/) project scholarship.

My primary interests lie in humanoid robot manipulation, multimodal large models for robots. Professionally, I am a Robotics Engineer at [Samsung R&D Institute China - Beijing](https://research.samsung.com/src-b) since September 2022. There, I have been involved in generating large-scale robot manipulation datasets for training large models and have also participated in internal competitions, such as the robot kitchen organization challenge, where I focused on grasp pose generation and planning.

Prior to my role at Samsung, I was a postdoctoral research assistant at the [University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/), where I worked on visual modules for detecting defects in wind turbine blades using drones. When I’m not immersed in robotics, I enjoy exploring new technologies and staying connected with the latest advancements in the field. Feel free to reach out if you’re interested in collaborating or discussing any topics related to robotics!
